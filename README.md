# [Project 1: Solid Waste Data Assessment]()
![alt text]()


Studied solid waste data simulated from economic models to assess predictive ability
of regressors on amount of solid trash generated. Corrected influential points, multicollinearity and dealt with outliers
to obtain optimum multiple linear regression model fit.


# [Project 2: Data Matching]()
![alt text]()



Performed natural language processing to identify non-exact matches of patent ids with companies
and institutions, implemented with final report in Python.

# [Project 3: Housing Data Prediction]() 
![alt text]()



Explored Boston housing data to forecast value of a home. Trained, tested and evaluated
KNN, LDA, QDA, and regression models. Used a k-fold cross-validation and cross-validation scores to compare
models.




# [Project 4: Android App Market]() 
![alt text]()


Employed a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten
thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. Learned insights in data and devised strategies to drive
growth and retention based on size and price of app, distribution of app ratings, and sentiment analysis.




# [Project 5: Predicting Credit Card Approvals]() 
![alt text]()



Built automatic credit card approval predictor using logistic regression and
performed a grid search of model parameters to improve the model's ability to predict credit card approvals.
