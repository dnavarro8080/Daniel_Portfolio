Studied solid waste data simulated from economic models to assess predictive ability
of regressors on amount of solid trash generated. Corrected influential points, multicollinearity and dealt with outliers
to obtain optimum multiple linear regression model fit.

Explored Boston housing data to forecast value of a home. Trained, tested and evaluated
KNN, LDA, QDA, and regression models. Used a k-fold cross-validation and cross-validation scores to compare
models.
